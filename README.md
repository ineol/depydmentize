# depygmentize

It inlines the highlighted code from the minted package. The resulting tex file
can be compiled without the shell-escape option. Which can be necessary if,
for instance, the tex file must be compiled on the editor's servers.

Also it can greatly reduce compile times.

## Usage
```bash
python3 depygmentize.py -i main.tex -o final.tex -l coq
```

looks for

```latex
\usepackage{minted}
\newminted{coq}{fontsize=\\footnotesize,mathescape}
```

and replaces all occurences of
```latex
\begin{coqcode}
...
\end{coqcode}
```

by the highlighting tex code generated by pygments.

### Other options
`-m x` changes the name of the defined macro in `\newminted{x}`. By default it
is the same as `-l`.

`-p x` changes the name of file that minted uses to define its macros. By
default it is `pygments_prelude.tex`.
